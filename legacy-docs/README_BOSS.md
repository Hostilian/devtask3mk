# Document Matrix: Alignment with the Assignment (For the Boss)

Possibilities are endless, here’s how each requested topic is addressed:

## Assignment Recap

> Define a data type D that represents a document subdivided horizontally or vertically into 1 or more cells that in turn can be further subdivided or can hold a value of some type A (A is a parameter). Equip the new data type D with

> `f[M[_]: Monad, A, B]: (A => M[B]) => D[A] => M[D[B]]`,
>
> such that
>
> - `f[Id](identity) = identity,`
> - `f[Option](Some(_)) = Some(_),`
>
> where Id[A] = A

## How the Project Aligns

- **Algebraic Data Types:**
  - The core `Document[A]` type is a sealed trait with case classes (`Leaf`, `Horizontal`, `Vertical`, `Empty`), covering sum types, product types, unit, and void.
- **Recursion Schemes:**
  - Implements catamorphisms (folds) and other recursion schemes for traversing and transforming documents.
- **Higher-Kinded Types:**
  - The function `f` and many abstractions use higher-kinded types (`M[_]`, `F[_]`).
- **Polymorphism:**
  - Uses parametric polymorphism (generic types), ad-hoc polymorphism (typeclasses), and subtype polymorphism (sealed trait hierarchy).
- **Functors, Applicatives, Monads, Composition:**
  - Provides `Functor`, `Applicative`, `Monad`, and `Traverse` instances for `Document`, enabling composition and effectful transformations.
- **Free:**
  - Includes a Free monad DSL for document operations, with interpreters for pure and effectful execution.
- **Effects:**
  - Integrates with ZIO and Cats Effect for effectful programming and validation.
- **Algebras:**
  - Defines multiple algebras (e.g., rendering, metrics) for processing documents in different ways.
- **Semigroup, Monoid:**
  - Implements `Semigroup` and `Monoid` instances for combining documents.
- **Type Safety:**
  - Uses Scala’s type system, phantom types, and compile-time validation to ensure correctness.
- **Validation, Parsing:**
  - Provides type-safe validation and parsing from JSON or custom syntax, with detailed error handling.
- **Type Driven Development:**
  - The design is guided by types, with property-based tests and compile-time guarantees.

## The Assignment Function

- The function `f[M[_]: Monad, A, B]: (A => M[B]) => D[A] => M[D[B]]` is implemented as a monadic traversal (`traverse`) over the document structure.
- Laws are verified:
  - `f[Id](identity) = identity` (pure, no effects)
  - `f[Option](Some(_)) = Some(_)` (structure preserved if all succeed)
- All code and tests are in `Document.scala`, `AssignmentVerification.scala`, and related files.

## Summary

Every required concept is implemented, tested, and demonstrated with real code, examples, and documentation. The project is a c0mplete, type-safe, and extensible solution, (this is the perfect usage for SCALA)
