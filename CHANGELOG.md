## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-07

### üöÄ Major Project Reorganization

#### Added
- **Modern Project Structure** - Reorganized into `backend/`, `frontend/`, and `infrastructure/` directories
- **Comprehensive README** - New polished documentation showcasing the full platform
- **Workspace Package.json** - Root-level npm workspace management for better monorepo handling
- **Updated Contributing Guide** - Clear guidelines for multi-stack development
- **MIT License** - Open source license for community contributions
- **Legacy Documentation** - Preserved historical docs in `legacy-docs/` directory

#### Changed
- **Project Identity** - Evolved from "Document Matrix" to "DevTask3MK - Multi-Stack Development Platform"
- **Directory Structure** - Moved from flat structure to organized modules:
  - `backend/` - All Scala code, including `core/`, `apps/`, and `src/`
  - `frontend/` - Modern web applications (Svelte Snake game)
  - `infrastructure/` - Docker, monitoring, and deployment configurations
- **Build Configuration** - Updated `build.sbt` to work with new directory structure
- **Docker Compose** - Updated service names and paths to reflect new organization
- **Git Ignore** - Enhanced `.gitignore` for better multi-stack development

#### Infrastructure
- **Container Names** - Updated from `document-matrix-*` to `devtask3mk-*`
- **Network Names** - Renamed to `devtask3mk-network` for consistency
- **Service Organization** - Cleaner separation between backend, frontend, and auxiliary services

#### Developer Experience
- **Workspace Scripts** - Added npm scripts for common development tasks:
  - `npm run dev` - Start frontend development server
  - `npm run backend:dev` - Start Scala backend server
  - `npm run docker:up` - Launch full stack with Docker
  - `npm start` - Quick start command
- **Better Documentation** - Clear setup instructions for different development scenarios
- **Unified Commands** - Consistent command patterns across backend and frontend

### üõ†Ô∏è Migration Guide

For existing users, here's how to adapt to the new structure:

#### Backend Development
```bash
# Old structure
sbt compile
sbt "runMain com.example.Server"

# New structure (still works!)
sbt compile
sbt "runMain com.example.Server"
# OR use npm scripts
npm run backend:compile
npm run backend:dev
```

#### Frontend Development
```bash
# Old structure
cd snake-game
npm run dev

# New structure
cd frontend/snake-game
npm run dev
# OR from root
npm run dev
```

#### Docker Operations
```bash
# Old structure
docker-compose up

# New structure
cd infrastructure
docker-compose up
# OR from root
npm run docker:up
```
