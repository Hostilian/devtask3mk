# Project Overview üéØ

## What This Project Does

This is a functional programming showcase built around a recursive document data structure. Think of it like a layout engine where you can split documents horizontally and vertically, but with all the fancy math from category theory backing it up.

## The Main Challenge

The assignment was to build:
1. A data type `D[A]` representing subdivided documents
2. A function `f[M[_]: Monad, A, B]: (A => M[B]) => D[A] => M[D[B]]`
3. Where specific laws hold (identity and Option laws)

**Spoiler:** The function is basically just `traverse` specialized for monads. But implementing it taught me a ton about how all these abstract concepts actually work in practice.

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

### Core Data Structure
```
Document[A] - The main algebraic data type
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Leaf[A] - Holds actual values
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Horizontal[A] - Left-to-right subdivision  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Vertical[A] - Top-to-bottom subdivision
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Empty[A] - Nothing here
```

### Type Class Instances
Every major type class from Cats:
- `Functor[Document]` - Transform values while preserving structure
- `Applicative[Document]` - Combine documents with functions
- `Monad[Document]` - Sequential document composition
- `Traverse[Document]` - Apply effects across structure (this is the key one!)
- `Semigroup[Document[A]]` - Combine documents associatively  
- `Monoid[Document[A]]` - Semigroup with identity (Empty)

### Free Monad DSL
Built a domain-specific language for document operations:
```scala
val program = for {
  doc1 <- createLeaf("Hello")
  doc2 <- createLeaf("World")
  combined <- createHorizontal(List(doc1, doc2))
} yield combined
```

### Multiple Interpreters
- Pure interpreter (Id)
- Effectful interpreter (Option)
- Could easily add more (IO, ZIO, etc.)

## Why This is Actually Cool üòé

### 1. Real-World Applicable
This isn't just academic theory - you could use this pattern for:
- Layout engines (think CSS Flexbox but type-safe)
- Configuration systems with validation
- Data processing pipelines
- Any hierarchical data with operations

### 2. Compositional
Everything builds on simple, mathematical foundations:
- Combine simple operations into complex workflows
- Type safety prevents entire classes of bugs
- Laws ensure behavior is predictable

### 3. Effect Polymorphic
The same code works with different effect types:
```scala
// Pure computation
Document.f[Id, String, String](_.toUpperCase)(doc)

// With validation  
Document.f[Option, String, String](validateInput)(doc)

// With error handling
Document.f[Either[Error, *], String, String](parseAndValidate)(doc)
```

## Performance Characteristics üìä

### Memory
- Immutable data structures with structural sharing
- Empty documents don't allocate extra memory
- Large documents share common subtrees

### CPU
- Catamorphisms are tail-recursive where possible
- Traverse operations are stack-safe
- No reflection or runtime type checking

### Scalability
- Operations scale linearly with document size
- Parallel processing possible (not implemented but structure supports it)
- Lazy evaluation where beneficial

## Testing Strategy üß™

### Unit Tests
Basic functionality verification in `DocumentSpec.scala`

### Property-Based Tests  
Mathematical law verification in `DocumentPropertySpec.scala`:
- Functor laws (identity, composition)
- Monad laws (left/right identity, associativity)
- Traversal laws (naturality, identity, composition)
- Semigroup/Monoid laws

### Integration Tests
End-to-end workflows in `AdvancedDocumentSpec.scala`

### Assignment Verification
Explicit checking of assignment requirements in `AssignmentVerification.scala`

## Extension Points üîß

### New Algebras
Add custom processing logic:
```scala
trait MyCustomAlgebra[A] {
  def processLeaf(value: A): Result
  def processHorizontal(children: List[Result]): Result
  // ...
}
```

### New Effect Types
Works with any `Monad[F[_]]`:
```scala
// ZIO integration
Document.f[ZIO[Any, Nothing, *], String, String](ZIO.succeed)(doc)

// Cats Effect IO
Document.f[IO, String, String](IO.pure)(doc)
```

### New Operations
Extend the Free monad DSL:
```scala
case class TransformDocument[A, B](doc: Document[A], f: A => B) extends DocumentAlgebra[Document[B]]
```

## Learning Outcomes üìö

Building this taught me:

1. **ADTs aren't just syntax** - They model problem domains naturally
2. **Type classes compose beautifully** - Small interfaces, big power
3. **Laws matter** - They're not just academic, they enable reasoning
4. **Free monads are practical** - Great for testable, composable DSLs
5. **Effect polymorphism is powerful** - Write once, run with any effect type

The coolest realization: The assignment's function `f` is just `traverse` specialized for monads. All that category theory actually has practical applications!

## What's Next? üöÄ

Potential extensions:
- [ ] Lens/Optics for deep document updates
- [ ] Streaming support for large documents  
- [ ] GraphQL API with effect polymorphism
- [ ] Property-based test generators
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Parallel processing combinators

*This started as a homework assignment but turned into a pretty solid foundation for functional programming in Scala. The type system really does make impossible states impossible!*
